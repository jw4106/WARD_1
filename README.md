Wearable Action Recognition

This application was created using Android Studio (Java) to help record and track motion on a smart phone based off of the 
Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer sensors. Movements all have different motions which can be recorded based off the 
three sensors (utilization of the X,Y, and Z axis). This application records data every 38 milliseconds and records the data
into a standard text file for data analysis further on.
